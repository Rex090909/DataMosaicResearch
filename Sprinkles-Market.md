Some of the key drivers and trends expected to shape the market include:</p><ul> <li><strong>Increased Focus on Sustainability:</strong> As sustainability becomes a central concern for consumers, the demand for eco-friendly sprinkles made with natural, non-GMO ingredients is expected to increase. Companies are likely to respond by developing biodegradable or recyclable packaging solutions alongside ingredient innovations.</li> <li><strong>Global Expansion:</strong> As emerging markets in Asia, Latin America, and Africa continue to grow economically, sprinkles are expected to gain popularity in these regions.
