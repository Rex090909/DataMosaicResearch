However, the exact pace of this growth will depend on global economic conditions, technological advancements, and consumer behavior trends.</p> <p>In conclusion, while the cardio equipment market from 2018 to 2022 was defined by a surge in home fitness solutions and tech innovations, the market from 2023 to 2033 is expected to evolve with a focus on sustainability, integration of AI and VR, and a growing hybrid fitness ecosystem.
